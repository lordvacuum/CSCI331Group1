Objective
The goal of this gamification project is to enhance students' learning experience with T-SQL using Azure Data Studio and SQL Notebooks. Students will work in pairs, alternating between the roles of Business Stakeholder and Programmer/Analyst, to solve real-world problems using the provided sample databases. The samples below are for style and are trivial. You will try to push your personal envelope with your pair programmer to delve deeply into your understanding of SQL for perspective employers.
The assignment is 7 cases per group member collaborating in 2 pairs
Learn to be pro-active and ask questions when you do not understand something. Questioning is your due dilgence and demonstrates that you are starting to understand that time in business is quantified in terms of money and working solutions.
Each case will be a different scenario that requires the use of appropriate tools in your personal toolbelt (Azure Data Studio, SQL Notebooks, etc.) T-SQL queries, sub-queries, Views, Table Expressions, CTE, Scalar and inline table functions, cross and outer appply, and stored procedures. To demonstrate the skills that you have gained to this point in the semester
Create MP4 3.5 to 5 minutes at a minimum per each video solution. Each case will be presented by the Navigator of the drivers solution and the shared collaboration in the development.
Submit your code to GitHub with a README.md file explaining all of your answers in one or two sentences with a link to your video in the README.md
